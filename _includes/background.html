      As a software engineer, I enjoy  bridging the gap between engineering and
      design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
      design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build
      applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while
      providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      volleyball, making pottery, or jumping into bodies of water.
